# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
 Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Deliverables
 - Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
 - Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
 - Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis (README.md)

## Results
 - Below is the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), which was used extensively to visualize the relationships betweeen all of the given data sources.
